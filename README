***************************************************    


This is a simple buildroot project example.  The 
instructions below describe where to place the files.

I have tried to add some comments in the file to 
describe some of the components.   I am sure the
Instructions will improve after I forgot what I did
and have to figure this out again.

=> Directory Structure:

The "twsi_tool" code base will need to be installed in one of two 
locations (A or B). 
 
    (A)  places the file in the "sdk_base" directory with the rest 
         of the Marvell code base.  (My Instructions will follow "A".
         Feel Free to use "B" addif you like)
    (B)  places the file in the "buildroot" directory with the rest 
         of the buildroot code base/packages.  .
 

A) twsi_tool installed with Marvell Code

  <SDK> 
     |
     - buildroot
     |      |
     |      - package
     |      |   
     |      - <Other buildroot folders>
     |
      - sdk_base  (older sdk's called this dir: "buildroot-external-marvell")
     |      |
     |      - package
     |      |      |
     |      |      - twsi_tool   (Create here to be with Marvell Code)     
     |      |      |      |
     |      |      |      - Config.in
     |      |      |      |
     |      |      |      - twsi_tool.mk
     |      |      |      |
     |      |      |      - (optional- any files/folders you want)
     |      |      |

     |      - <Other sdk_base folders>
     |
     - "output" and other sdk folders
     |  
     v


B) twsi_tool installed in the buildroot directory with the buildroot code. 

  <SDK> 
     |
     - buildroot
     |      |
     |      - package
     |      |      |
     |      |      - twsi_tool    (Create here to be with Buildroot Code)  
     |      |      |      |
     |      |      |      - Config.in
     |      |      |      |
     |      |      |      - twsi_tool.mk
     |      |      |      |
     |      |      |      - (optional- any files/folders you want)
     |      |      |
     |      |      - <Other standard OpenWRT Packages>     
     |      |      |
     |      |      v 
     |      |   
     |      - <Other buildroot folders>
     |
      - sdk_base   (older sdk's called this dir: "buildroot-external-marvell")
     |      |
     |      - package
     |      |      |
     |      |      - <Other Marvell based OpenWRT Packages>     
     |      |      |
     |      |      v 
     |      - <Other sdk_base folders>
     |
     - "output" and other sdk folders
     |  
     v




=> File Info:

    "Config.in" -> used by Buildroot's "make menuconfig" command to 
      place entries in the menu. By default, the twsi_tool package 
      is not included by default. (equivalent to Kconfig in linux kernel) 

    "twsi_tool.mk" -> Tells buildroot
        a) where to find the package source code 
        b) what mechanism to download/fetch 
        c) how/when to build/compile the package
        d) where the resulting executible should be placed in the 
              target System.

     |      |                 This will also transfer the .tgz file to 
     |      |                 your HTTP server. (you need "ssh user keys"
     |      |                 added, you also need access to place the files
     |      |                 in the proper location for the http server )

     |             - uninstall -> A bash script (really more of a clean 
     |                     Script). Must be placed in the buildroot <output> 
     |                     directory. Does a clean removal of the package,  
     |                     Script Variables OUTPUT_DIR and BASE_DIR
     |                     must be updated before running. 
     |                     The script will remove any cached components of 
     |                     the "package". (This includes a copy in the 
     |                     download cache if BR2_DL_DIRECTORY is defined.) 
     |                     When you run "make twsi_tool", buildroot will reload 
     |                     the code from the location specified in the 
     |                     <output>/sdk_base/package/twsi_tool/config.in file.
     | 
     |             | 
     |             - install -> a bash script which must be run from directory
     |                        where the "install" script is place as part of
     |                        pulling the code from GITHUB.  Script variables 
     |                        OUTPUT_DIR and  BASE_DIR must be updated before
     |                        running the script. The script will:
     |                          1) delete any pre-existing 
     |                             .../sdk-base/package/twsi_tool directory.
     |                          2) Create a new .../package/twsi_tool directory
     |                          3) Copy Config.in and twsi_tool.mk from 
     |                              ../package to .../sdk-base/package/twsitool  
     |                          4) Modify the <SDK>/sdk-base/Config.in script  
     |                             to include twsi_tool in the buildroot build.
     |             | 


 
=> Comments on my implementation:

    1) My Directory Structure vs the SDK documentation....
    
       I create the following directory structure ~/marvell/sdk/SDK_<revison>,
       and explode the downloaded sdk in the SDK_<revision> folder
        
       The SDK documentation has you create a work directory an explode the
       downloade sdk into ~/work

       Please adjust paths and scripts to reflect your directory structure.
       
    2) Buildroot can download a package via multiple mechanisms. The method
       of download is specified in the twsi_tool.mk file.  I have tested
       Both Mechanisms below.  
     
       The script "force_rebuild" will create a tarball which can be used 
       by buildroot's twsi_tool.mk instructions. 

       a) From an http server:
            Modify twsi_tool.mk to get the "twsi_tool.tgz"
            source code from my web server on Hooch (10.11.65.84:80)

          from twsi_tool.mk:
            #TWSI_TOOL_SITE_METHOD = wget
            #TWSI_TOOL_SITE = root@10.11.65.84:80

       b) From a directory:
             
         The "twsi_tool.mk" also has lines which will fetch a 
          "twsi_tool.tgz" file from  a local directory on the
          build machine. The location I have specified in "twsi_tool.mk"
          is:
             /scratch/twsi_tool/twsi_tool.tgz

          from twsi_tool.mk:
            TWSI_TOOL_SITE_METHOD = file
            TWSI_TOOL_SITE = /scratch/twsi_tool

          Note: the script force_rebuild will create the tarball you need
                Script variables  REV and BASENAME should not change.


       c) you can also fetch project source via wget, http, or scp.

       d) WARNING:  buildroot will add "/" for you as part of the
           target/"TWSI_TOOL_SITE"  location.

       e) WARNING: Buildroot will by default strip the first
           "path directory" in your .tgz file.  My .mk file overrides this
           to not strip any directory path.

          from twsi_tool.mk:
            TWSI_TOOL_STRIP_COMPONENTS=0

    3) I set up a Github progject that you "clone" to a working directory.  
         From there, you must manually copy project files to the proper 
         location in buildroot.  Additionally you must modify buildroot's 
         make and configure files to have the twsi_tool package build as 
         part of calliing make.   
         
    4) <REVISION> of the package is defined in twsi_tool.mk


=> Get the files
   1)  get the twsi_tool package from Github, place the source in the top 
       level directory "/scratch"
   
   cd /
   mkdir -p /scratch
   cd /scratch
   git clone https://github.com/fmcoastal/buildroot_twsi_tool.git  twsi_tool

   2) the files and file structure should look like what is shown above. 

   3) build the source tar file required by build root for package source files. 
       the script "force_rebuild" will put the contentes of the twsi_tool directory into 
       a .tgz file in a format which buildroot will later explode into the 
       directory  <sdk>/<output>/build/twsi_tool-1.0.0  when Make is run.
   
       cd /scratch/twsi_tool
       ./force_rebuild

       When prompted to transfer files to your http server, enter "n". 

   3.1) If necessary, transfer resulting .tgz file in the location specified 
         in the "package/twsi_tool.mk" location.  Recall from above that I 
         am using a local directory, and if you are following my example 
         explicitly, the location the file should be in /scratch/twsi-tool

=> Configure buildroot  - use the /scratch/helpers/install script. 

    4) Modify the "install" script's OUTPUT_DIR and BASE_DIR 
        variable to match your environment 
         
        OUTPUT_DIR=cn96xx-release-output
        BASE_DIR=/home/fsmith/marvell/sdk/SDK-10.1.1.0
       
    5) Run the Script
     
       cd /scratch/twsi_tool
       ./install

    6) Configure buildroot to build twsi_tool

	cd <sdk>/<output>
        make menuconfig
     
       go to "External options->twsi_tool"
       "*" the box to have it built as part of the make process

       exit and save

    7) Force a build of the twsi tool app

       cd <sdk>/<output>
       make twsi_tool     
 
           Note: depending on which device you are building the tool for, you 
             you may need to add in, or comment out #include <i2c.h> from 
             twsi_tool.c.

              
       "twsi-tool" app can be found in 

       <sdk>/<output>/build/twsi_tool-1.0.0/twsi_tool

       you can transfer the executable to your target system, or rebuild
       the rootfs (rebuilding the rootfs puts twsi_tool in your /bin directory


     8) running the twsi tool app...
        
        for the device you want to query, you need
             a)  which i2c bus the device is attatched to (schematics)
             b)  what i2c address was assigned (schematics)
             c)  how to talk to the device  (device Data Sheet)
 
       running ./twsi_tool with no arguments will print help instructions.
      


=> Configure buildroot  - manual Placement
    
    4) Determine which package location you want to install the
         twsi_tool package in.  For me, I will use the
         <SDK>/sdk-base/package location.  
        (You could also place it in <SDK>/buildroot/package location)

    5) cd buildroot or sdk-base (buildroot-external-marvell)

    cd  /sdk/<SDK>/sdk-base/package

    6) Make a directory twsi_tool

    mkdir -p twsi_tool

    7) copy Config.in and twsi_tool.mk from your git download
       to your

    cd twsi_tool
    cp /scratch/twsi_tool/package/Config.in .
    cp /scratch/twsi_tool/package/twsi_tool.mk .
 
    8) Modify <sdk>/buildroot-external-marvell/Config.in to have it look in
       the packages/twsi_tool directory for a Config.in file

       add the following to the last line in the "<sdk>/buildroot-external
       -marvell/Config.in" file

       source "$BR2_EXTERNAL_MARVELL_SDK_PATH/package/twsi_tool/Config.in"
    

    9) (REFERENCE) the <sdk>/buildroot-external-marvell/external.mk is written to 
       walk through each directory in the Package file and look for a .mk file when 
       the "make" is executed in the <output> directory.
 
       The twsi_tool.mk file tells build root about revision info, where to 
       find source code, how to unpack source code. In addition, the are multiple
       other defines which can be implemented to support the install process. Look 
       specifically at 
       
        https://buildroot.org/downloads/manual/manual.html#writing-rules-mk
        and 
        https://buildroot.org/downloads/manual/manual.html#hooks


     10) if everything is configured correctly, you should be able to execute 
        "make twsi_tool" in your <output> dirctory.  Buildroot will:
            create the folling directory:  "<output>/build/twsi_tool-1.0.0"  
         the folder will have:
               I.  your source code in it. 
              II.  the compiled output.  (twsi_tool)
             III.  and if you rebuild your rootfs, a copy of the "twsi_tool" executible
                   will be in the /bin directory. 
       
         transfer the executable to your target, and run twsi_tool!
